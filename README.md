# Rapport Script Syntax Highlighting

This is a simple Notepad++ UDL (User Define Language) file I made to make it easier to use to read Wyse Device Manager script files, known as .rsp (Rapport Scripts) files

The syntax is based on the [WDM 5.0 Admin guide](https://appservices.wyse.com/supportdownload/WDM/Dell%20Wyse%20Device%20Manager%205.0%20-%20Administrator%20Guide.pdf).
